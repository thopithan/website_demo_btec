      The arena doesn't have its own car park, but there are 7,500 parking spaces within a 15-minute walk, so you shouldn't have any trouble finding a spot. Woodhouse Lane Car Park is just a short walk away, with easy access to the A58 part of the inner ring road. Merrion Centre Car Park is the closest, and is situated just across the road on Merrion Way. Both are open for 24 hours.</div>
